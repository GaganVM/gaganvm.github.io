Welcome! I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at UC San Diego (Sep. 2024 – Mar. 2026), working on machine learning and deep learning research. My research interests include vision-language models, music intelligence, conversational AI, and their applications in recommendation systems.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi (Nov. 2020 – Jun. 2024) with a GPA of 3.98/4.00.
